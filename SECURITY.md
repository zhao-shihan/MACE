# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to help keep the MACESW project secure. This document explains how to responsibly report security vulnerabilities and how we handle reports.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Preferred method:**
- **Create a GitHub Security Advisory for this repository: https://github.com/zhao-shihan/MACESW/security/advisories/new**

When reporting, please include as much of the following as you can:
- Affected component(s) and version(s) (commit SHA, tag, or branch)
- A concise description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (minimal reproduction is extremely helpful)
- Proof-of-concept code or test case, if available
- Any suggested remediation or mitigation
- Your contact information and how you prefer to be credited (or request anonymity)

If you are unable to use the GitHub Security Advisory workflow for any reason, please contact the project owner privately, or open an issue but avoid including any exploit details until a fix is available.

## Supported releases

We consider the main branch and the latest tagged release as supported. If you report a vulnerability, please indicate the affected versions (tags or commit SHAs). We will prioritize fixes for the current stable release and the main branch.

## Out-of-scope

Security issues in third-party dependencies should be reported to the maintainers of those dependencies as well as here when appropriate. Supply-chain attacks or vulnerabilities in external build tools should be reported upstream in their respective projects.

## Credit

Unless you request otherwise, we will credit people who report security issues in release notes or advisories.

## Legal

We encourage security researchers to follow responsible disclosure practices. We will not pursue legal action against good-faith security research that follows the above guidance. We expect reporters to avoid intentionally destructive behavior and to avoid accessing or modifying data not needed to demonstrate the issue.

Thank you for helping improve the security of MACESW.
